### EasyGo

## Overview
Over 1.3 billion people worldwide live with some form of disability, many of whom face daily challenges with mobility in public spaces. Current navigation tools lack real-time data to avoid obstacles, making navigation risky and unpredictable for people with disabilities.

Using data on path accessibility, this tool identifies routes that are wheelchair-friendly by avoiding stairs.

Simply input your start and final destination, and our route finder will suggest the most accessible path for you.

## Tech Stack
Frontend: React, Leaflet, TailwindCSS
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Graphhopper

## Getting Started
# Prerequisites
* Node.js installed
* MongoDB Atlas account or local MongoDB setup
# Installation
* cd frontend
* npm i
* npm run start

## Future Development
We aim to focus on using more advanced algorithms to find better and safer paths based on topography and slope angles. We also plan to use machine learning to analyze user-generated feedback over time to predict common obstacles and recommend the best paths.
